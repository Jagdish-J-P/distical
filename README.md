# Distical

Distical is a simple distance calculator library for PHP 5.3+ which
amongst other things can calculate the distance between two lat/long
co-ordinates.

# Usage example

Its rather simple, I'm sure that I don't need to bore you with all the class
methods (there's not many at the moment anyway) but I've demonstrated each
method, method chaining and commented on their usage etc. in the example file
provided at the following location:

``examples/index.php``

Enjoy!
